            <p>
                Cookies are pieces of data that sites and services you use or visit can set on your browser or device and they
                can typically be read on future visits to learn more about the User and to personalize an experience, including
                the ads that are displayed to the User. "Cookies" is also a term that may be used to refer to a range of
                technologies that help an operator identify Users and devices, which in turn can help personalize an experience,
                prevent fraud, store preferences, and speed up delivery of content.

                    We build this website using Microsoft ASP.NET Core technology. ASP.NET Core provides cookie middleware which
                    serializes a user principal into an encrypted cookie and then, on subsequent requests, validates the cookie,
                    recreates the principal and assigns it to the User property on HttpContext.

                    Cookie to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks in ASP.NET Core. Cross-site request forgery
                    (also known as XSRF or CSRF) is an attack against web-hosted apps whereby a malicious web app can influence
                    the interaction between a client browser and a web app that trusts that browser. These attacks are possible
                    because web browsers send some types of authentication tokens automatically with every request to a website.
                    This form of exploit is also known as a one-click attack or session riding because the attack takes advantage
                    of the user's previously authenticated session.
